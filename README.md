Task Instructions

1Ô∏è Create a ViewModel

        ‚Ä¢    Implement MainViewModel that provides a StateFlow<List>, where each Character contains: 

        ‚Ä¢    data class Character(val id: Int, val name: String, val status: String, val species: String, val image: String)

        ‚Ä¢    Fetch 10 random characters from the Rick and Morty API:
                API Endpoint: https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character
        
        ‚Ä¢    Store the list in StateFlow and update it when fetchCharacters() is called.

 
2Ô∏è Implement Dependency Injection with Hilt

        ‚Ä¢    Set up Hilt for Dependency Injection.

        ‚Ä¢    Create a CharacterRepository class that: 

        ‚Ä¢    Fetches data from the API using Retrofit.

        ‚Ä¢    Exposes a function to return characters as a Flow.

        ‚Ä¢    Inject CharacterRepository into MainViewModel.

 
3Ô∏è Display Data in Jetpack Compose UI

        ‚Ä¢    Modify MainActivity to observe the StateFlow from MainViewModel.

        ‚Ä¢    Display the list of characters in a LazyColumn (RecyclerView alternative in Compose).

        ‚Ä¢    Each list item should contain: 

        ‚Ä¢    Character image (use Coil library for image loading)

        ‚Ä¢    Character name (big font)

        ‚Ä¢    Character status and species (smaller font, below the name)

        ‚Ä¢    Loading State: Show a progress indicator while fetching characters.

 
4Ô∏è Add Refresh Button

        ‚Ä¢    Include a button to fetch new characters when clicked.
